1. Make your own data store! Read/Write to a JSON file instead of using an array for storage.
2. Use OOP to help refactor your logic for reading/writing. This is almost like building your own ORM!
3. Build a front-end that interacts with your API. This will involve figuring out how to load static assets with express. Try doing this in jQuery, or vanilla JavaScript (ultra challenge)!
